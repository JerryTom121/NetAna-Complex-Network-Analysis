MNet 3.0 - Complex Network Analysis Package
===========================================

Extraction and analysis of several graph features from publicly available datasets using NetworkX.

Features Analyzed:
------------------

* Assortativity
* Clique number
* Clustering
* Density
* Diameter
* Edge connectivity
* Isolates.
* Node connectivity
* Number of cliques
* Number of edges
* Number of nodes
* Radius
* Clustering and Transitivity
* Betweeness centrality
* Closeness centrality
* Communicability centrality
* Coreness
* Degree centrality
* Eccentricity
* Number of triangles
* Pagerank
* Square clustering
* Hop number
* Expansion
* Distortion
* Girth




Networks:
---------
* Social networks: online social networks, edges represent interactions between people
* Ground truth: ground-truth network communities in social and information networks 
* Communication: email communication networks with edges representing communication
* Citation: nodes represent papers, edges represent citations
* Collaboration: nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper)
* Web graphs: nodes represent webpages and edges are hyperlinks
* Products: nodes represent products and edges link commonly co-purchased products
* p2p: nodes represent computers and edges communication
* Roads: nodes represent intersections and edges roads connecting the intersections
* Autonomous systems: graphs of the internet
* Signed networks: networks with positive and negative edges (friend/foe, trust/distrust)
* Location based networks: Social networks with geographic check-ins
* Wikipedia: Talk, editing and voting data from Wikipedia
* Memetracker: Memetracker phrases, links
* Online communities:  Data from online communities such as Reddit and Flickr
* Online reviews: Data from online review systems such as BeerAdvocate and Amazon


Normalization and Graph sampling:
---------------------------------
Performed using snowball sampling.
